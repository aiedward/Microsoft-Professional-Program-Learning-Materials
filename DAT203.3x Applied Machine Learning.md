# Time Series and Forcasting
## Introduction to Time Series
Time Series Decomposition = Trending + Seasonal + Remainder
![Time Series Decomposition]()

Trending - 
Lowess/Loess Regression
![trending]()
Seasonal - 
Low-pass Filtering / Moving Average
Notes: You have to know the cycle length
![LPF]()
![stationarity]()


## Working with Time Series
### MA - Moving Average 
- Weighted Average of Noise. - Always Stationary
### AR - AutoRegressive 
- Weighted Average of Past Values. - NOT always Stationary
![MA+AR]()

### Partial Autocorrelation
![partial_corr]()
### ARMA
![ARMA]()
### ARIMA
### EWMA
![ARIMA_EWMA]()
