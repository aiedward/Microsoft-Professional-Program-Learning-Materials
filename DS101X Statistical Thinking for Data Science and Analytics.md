[But P-value is intrinsically cofusing!](http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700#/cause)
This article suggested the following:
> Most scientists would look at his original P value of 0.01 and say that there was just a 1% chance of his result being a false alarm. But they would be wrong. The P value cannot say this: all it can do is summarize the data assuming a specific null hypothesis. It cannot work backwards and make statements about the underlying reality.

> According to one widely used calculation5, a P value of 0.01 corresponds to a false-alarm probability of at least 11%, depending on the underlying probability that there is a true effect; a P value of 0.05 raises that chance to at least 29%. So Motyl's finding had a greater than one in ten chance of being a false alarm. Likewise, the probability of replicating his original result was not 99%, as most would assume, but something closer to 73% â€” or only 50%, if he wanted another 'very significant' result6, 7. In other words, his inability to replicate the result was about as surprising as if he had called heads on a coin toss and it had come up tails.

### Topic Modeling

![Topic Modeling](https://github.com/yang0339/Microsoft-Professional-Program-Learning-Materials/blob/master/DS101X%20Statistical%20Thinking%20for%20Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics/Topic%20Modeling.jpg)

#### Mixed Membership Models
> Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Basically, it is a **Dirichlet** distribution of **topic over words** and **documents over topics**; and **Multinomial** distribution of **words over topics**.

Some useful pictures for illustration.
