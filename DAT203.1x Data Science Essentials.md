## LAB

### Drop Column
```R
# in R
DF <- data.frame(
  x=1:10,
  y=10:1,
  z=rep(5,10),
  a=11:20
)
drops <- c("x","z")
DF[ , !(names(DF) %in% drops)]
```
```python
# in Python
 drop_cols = ['SexAndStatus', 'OtherDetorsGuarantors']
 creditframe.drop(drop_cols, axis = 1, inplace = True)
 ```
 
 #### view stats
 ```python
 # in Python: use describe()
desc = df[col].describe()
# optional: change index of '50%' to 'median' 
idx = desc.index.tolist()
idx[5] = 'median'
desc.index = idx

# a good example on boxplot and histogram
def plotstats(df, col):
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    ## Setup for ploting two charts one over the other
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize = (12,8))
    
    ## First a box plot
    df.dropna().boxplot(col, ax = ax[0], vert=False,
                        return_type='dict')
    ## Plot the histogram   
    temp = df[col].as_matrix()
    ax[1].hist(temp, bins = 30, alpha = 0.7)
    plt.ylabel('Number of Cars')
    plt.xlabel(col)
    return [col]
```

# Module 3: Simulation and Hypothesis Testing

## Types of Test
### Single-Sample T-Tests and Z-Tests
* A z-test (normal distributions with a known population standard deviation, or for data sets with more than 30 independent observations â€“ in which case the sample standard deviation is close enough to the population standard deviation)
* A t-test (which can be used with a small number of observations and when the population standard deviation is not known).
* The result of the z-test or t-test includes a **p-value**, which you can use to determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis.

### Two-Sample Tests
* Comparing the mean weights of two different cupcake flavors is an example of an unpaired test. The individual observations (the measured weights of each cupcake) are independent
* some two-sample tests are paired tests in which there is a dependency between the observations in the two datasets. For example, suppose you wanted to test the hypothesis that the daily average sales figure of chocolate cupcakes is higher than that of vanilla cupcakes. In this case, the two sets of observations must be **paired** so that the first observation in each sample is the total favor-specific sales for the first day, the second observation is the total favor-specific sales for the second day, and so on.


# Module 4: Exploring and Visualizing Data
## Exploring Data
Data Frames in R: use ***dplyr***

## Visualizing Data
